      "Text": "<span>Born in a small village to a family of bakers, the character showed a love for storytelling at a young age, often narrating grand adventures to their pet goat, who undoubtedly became the most well-informed goat in the region. They embarked on a journey to become a bard, only to discover they were tone-deaf\u2014though their enthusiasm was unmatched. Undeterred, they became a traveling storyteller, collecting tales and sharing them with anyone willing to listen, even if some listeners were only there for the free snacks. Along the way, they accidentally started a dance craze involving juggling baguettes (a nod to their baking roots). Now semi-famous, they continue to wander the land, leaving behind a trail of laughter, crumbs, and confused goats.</span>```",
